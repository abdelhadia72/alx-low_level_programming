The C programming language allows functions to call themselves, giving birth to the concept of recursion.

üîÑ Recursion in action:
   Function calls itself, which calls itself again, and again...

ü§Ø Mind blown by recursion!
   It's a powerful concept that can solve complex problems with elegance.

üîÅ Recursion is like a Russian doll:
   A function inside a function, inside another function...
   It's functions all the way down!

üí° Programmer's wisdom:
   "To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion."
